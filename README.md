# applied_ml_final_project

For the final project, I chose to do option #2 "Create a Publically Available Machine Learning Resource." 

I used the Maternity Health Risk Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data) to train a model that can predict an individual's risk of health issues during pregnancy. Risk can either be low, mid, or high and takes into account factors such as age, blood sugar and pressure, body temperature and heartrate. The model that is used in my final app is a Random Forest Classsifier that achieved an average 85% accuracy using cross validation. 

This repository is the same repository that is linked with Heroku for deployment of this machine learning resource. This repository also contains a Jupyter Notebook where I explored and prepared the dataset for training, tested several prediction algorithms, and determined the best one to use for the final app.
